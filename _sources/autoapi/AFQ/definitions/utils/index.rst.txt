.. class:: Definition


   Bases: :py:obj:`object`

   All Definitions should inherit this.
   For a given subject and session within the API, the definition is used
   to create a given mask, map, etc.
   Definitions have an init function which the users uses to specify
   how they want the definition to behave.
   The find_path and get_for_subses functions are called by the AFQ API.
   The api calls find_path to let the definition find relevant files
   for the given subject and session. The api calls get_for_subses to get the
   mask, map, etc.

      as arguments to config files.
