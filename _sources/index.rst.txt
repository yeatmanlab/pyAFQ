Automated Fiber Quantification in Python (pyAFQ)
-------------------------------------------------

pyAFQ is an open-source software tool for the analysis of brain white matter in
diffusion MRI measurements. It implements a complete and automated data
processing pipeline for tractometry, from raw DTI data to white matter tract identification
, as well as quantification of tissue properties along the length of the 
major long-range brain white matter connections.


.. todo::
  create and link to page that lists the `major fiber tracts` supported by
  default. include information on how to add custom fiber bundles defintions.

.. todo::
  create and link to page that identifies the supported `tissue properties`
  (believe this includes both dti and dki? fa, md, cfa?, and pdd?)

.. note::

  Tractography is concerned with the visualization and mapping of white matter
  tracts in the brain, while tractometry involves the quantitative analysis of 
  the structural properties of these tracts. Both techniques are valuable in 
  understanding the brain's connectivity and can provide insights into various 
  neurological conditions and cognitive processes. More information can be found in
  the Explanations page.
