================================
Delineating cerebellar peduncles
================================

The cerebellar peduncles are white matter tracts that connect the cerebellum to
the brainstem and cortex. In this example, we show how to delineate the
cerebellar peduncles using a subject from the Healthy Brain Network dataset.

This how-to will focus on the definition of the Cerebellar Peduncles (CP) based
on [1]_, [2].

    defined by two inclusion ROIs and one exclusion ROI. The Inferior CPs are
    defined by inclusion ROIs. They do not decussate, so "cross_midline" is set to
    False. The Superior CPs are defined by two inclusion ROIs and an exclusion ROI,
    where each SCP's most superior inclusion ROI is the other SCP's exclusion ROI.
