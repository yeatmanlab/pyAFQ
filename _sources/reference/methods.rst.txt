The pyAFQ API methods
---------------------
After defining your pyAFQ API object, you can ask for the output of
any step of the pipeline. It is common for users to just call export_all
(for example, `myafq.export_all()`). However, if the user only wants the
tractography, the user can instead call `myafq.export("streamlines")`. Here
is a list of all of pyAFQ's possible outputs:
