This example and\nresulting pyAFQ support for pediatric bundles was inspired by and largely due\nto the work of Grotheer et al. [Grotheer2022]_, as implemented in\n[Grotheer2023]_.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Because it is time and disk-space consuming, this example\n    is not run when the pyAFQ documentation is built. To run this example\n    yourself, you can download the contents of this file as an\n    executable `.py` file or as a Jupyter notebook from the links at the bottom\n    of the page.</p></div>\n"

        "## Baby dMRI data\n\nInfant MRI data are quite different from data acquired in grownup\nparticipants, and even from children that are just a few years older.\nFirst, there is the rather obvious difference in size. Baby brains are\napproximately 25% the size of grownup brains at birth. But there are also\noften less known differences in brain tissue properties. For example, the\nmyelin content of white matter is much lower in infants than in grownups.\nThis is important because the diffusion signal that we measure with dMRI is\nsensitive to the myelin content, and it means that the dMRI signal differs\nquite a bit in newborn infants. For the purpose of delineating the major\nwhite matter pathways, it is also important to know that their shape,\nlocation and curvature is different in infants than in grownups. For example,\nthe arcuate fasciculus is much more curved in infants than in grownups.\nBecause of this, we use a different set of templates for infant brains than\nfor grownup brains. These templates were created and validated by\nMareike Grotheer and colleagues in [Grotheer2022]_. They are available for\ndownload as part of the pyAFQ software, as we will show below.\n\nIn this example, we will demonstrate the use of pyAFQ on data from one\ninfant. The data, provided by Kalanit Grill Spector's\n`Stanford Vision and Perception Neuroscience Lab <http://vpnl.stanford.edu/>`,\nand was previously published in [Grotheer2022]_.\nThe data is available to download on\n`Figshare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Example_babyAFQ_BIDS_subject/21440739>`.\nYou can download it from there and unzip it into ~/AFQ_Data/baby_example/\n(Note that this is 2.69GB of data, so it can take a while to download). Or\nyou can download it and unzip it using the following block of code.\n\n"

        "## Initialize a GroupAFQ object:\n\nNow that the data is downloaded and organized in a BIDS-compliant structure,\nwe can start running pyAFQ on it. We start by initializing a GroupAFQ object.\nThis object manages all of the data transformations and computations\nconducted by the software, based on its initial configuration, which we set\nup below.\n\nA few special things to note here:\n\n1. The data were preprocessed using the `vistasoft` pipeline, so we set\n   `preproc_pipeline = \"vistasoft\"`.\n2. We use the UNC neonatal template, which can be read on a call to the\n   `read_pediatric_templates` function in `AFQ.data.fetch`.\n3. We use the `baby_bd` to define the bundles that we want to\n   segment. This dictionary is different from the default behavior in that it\n   uses the waypoint ROIs from [Grotheer2022]_.\n4. In this case, tractography has already been run using\n   `MRTRIX <https://www.mrtrix.org/>`, and is accessed using the\n   `import_tract` key-word argument.\n5. We set `filter_by_endpoints = False` in the `segmentation_params` because\n   endpoint ROIs are not defined from newborn bundles.\n\n"
