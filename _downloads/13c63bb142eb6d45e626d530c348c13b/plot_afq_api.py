# Get some example data
# ---------------------
#
# Retrieves High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) dataset from
# Stanford's Vista Lab
#
#   see https://purl.stanford.edu/ng782rw8378 for details on dataset.
#
# The data for the first subject and first session are downloaded locally
# (by default into the users home directory) under:
#
#   ``.dipy/stanford_hardi/``
#
# Anatomical data (``anat``) and Diffusion-weighted imaging data (``dwi``) are
# then extracted, formatted to be BIDS compliant, and placed in the AFQ
# data directory (by default in the users home directory) under:
#
#   ``AFQ_data/stanford_hardi/``
#
# This data represents the required preprocessed diffusion data necessary for
# intializing the GroupAFQ object (which we will do next)
#
# The clear_previous_afq is used to remove any previous runs of the afq object
# stored in the AFQ_data/stanford_hardi/ BIDS directory. Set it to false if
# you want to use the results of previous runs.

afd.organize_stanford_data(clear_previous_afq=True)

# Initialize a GroupAFQ object:
# -------------------------
#
# Creates a GroupAFQ object, that encapsulates tractometry. This object can be
# used to manage the entire AFQ pipeline, including:
#
# - Tractography
# - Registration
# - Segmentation
# - Cleaning
# - Profiling
# - Visualization
#
# In this example we will load the subjects session data from the previous step
# using the default AFQ parameters.
#
# .. note::
#
#    The first time intializing the GroupAFQ object will download necessary
#    waypoint regions of interest (ROIs) templates into AFQ data directory:
#
# - Human corpus callosum templates: ``AFQ_data/callosum_templates/``
#
#   see https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/34926
#
# - Tract probability maps: ``AFQ_data/templates/``
#
#   see https://figshare.com/articles/Tract_probability_maps_for_automated_fiber_quantification/6270434  # noqa
#
# These waypoints ROIs will used to identify the desired white matter tracts.
#
# This will also create an output folder for the corresponding AFQ derivatives
# in the AFQ data directory: ``AFQ_data/stanford_hardi/derivatives/afq/``
#
# To initialize this object we will pass in the path location to our BIDS
# compliant data.
#
# .. note::
#
#    As noted above, the Stanford HARDI data contains anatomical and
#    diffusion weighted imaging (dwi) data. In this example, we are interested
#    in the vistasoft dwi. For our dataset the `dmriprep` is optional, but
#    we have included it to make the initialization more explicit.
#
# .. note::
#
#    We will also be using plotly to generate an interactive visualization.
#    So we will specify plotly_no_gif as the visualization backend.

myafq = GroupAFQ(
    bids_path=op.join(afd.afq_home, 'stanford_hardi'),
    preproc_pipeline='vistasoft',
    viz_backend_spec='plotly_no_gif')

# Reading in DTI FA (Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fractional Anisotropy)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The GroupAFQ object holds a table with file names to various data derivatives.
#
# For example, the file where the FA computed from DTI is stored can be
# retrieved by inspecting the ``dti_fa`` property. The measures are stored
# in a series, and since we only have one subject and one session we will
# access the first (and only) file name from the example data.
#
# .. note::
#
#    The AFQ API computes quantities lazily. This means that DTI parameters
#    are not computed until they are required. This means that the first
#    line below is the one that requires time.
#
# We will then use `nibabel` to load the deriviative file and retrieve the
# data array.

FA_fname = myafq.export("dti_fa")["01"]
FA_img = nib.load(FA_fname)
FA = FA_img.get_fdata()

##########################################################################
# Visualize the result with Matplotlib
# -------------------------------------
# At this point `FA` is an array, and we can use standard Python tools to
# visualize it or perform additional computations with it.
#
# In this case we are going to take an axial slice halfway through the
# FA data array and plot using a sequential color map.
#
# .. note::
#
#    The data array is structured as a xyz coordinate system.

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.matshow(FA[:, :, FA.shape[-1] // 2], cmap='viridis')
ax.axis("off")

##########################################################################
# Visualizing bundles and tract profiles:
# ---------------------------------------
# The pyAFQ API provides several ways to visualize bundles and profiles.
#
# First, we will run a function that exports an html file that contains
# an interactive visualization of the bundles that are segmented.
#
# .. note::
#    By default we resample a 100 points within a bundle, however to reduce
#    processing time we will only resample 50 points.
#
# Once it is done running, it should pop a browser window open and let you
# interact with the bundles.
#
# .. note::
#    Running the code below triggers the full pipeline of operations
#    leading to the computation of the tract profiles. Therefore, it
#    takes a little while to run (about 40 minutes, typically).
#
# .. note::
#    You can hide or show a bundle by clicking the legend, or select a
#    single bundle by double clicking the legend. The interactive
#    visualization will also all you to pan, zoom, and rotate.

bundle_html = myafq.export("all_bundles_figure")
plotly.io.show(bundle_html["01"])

##########################################################################
# We can also visualize the tract profiles in all of the bundles. These
# plots show both FA (left) and MD (right) layed out anatomically.
# To make this plots, it is required that you install with
# `pip install pyAFQ[plot]` so that you have the necessary dependencies.
#
