Tutorials
=========

Each of the following tutorials includes code and images to help walk you
through usage of pyAFQ. If you are new to the software and want to learn
about its usage, walk through each of these tutorials. In many cases,
the code has already been run and you can see the outputs. You can also
download a `.py` script or a `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file that you can run
on your own computer, after
`downloading and installing the pyAFQ software <installation_guide>`_.
